# OSS GTM Tool — `target-market`

An internal go-to-market intelligence tool for OSS. Two features in one
regular-looking SaaS, behind magic-link sign-in restricted to `@oss.ventures`:

1. **Signal Analyzer** — paste a company's website copy and/or describe your
   ICP. The tool surfaces the concrete, observable **buying signals** that
   indicate a strong fit, plus keywords and suggested filters — and can
   pre-filter the map to match.
2. **Industrial Map** — every industrial site (France, Europe, the US) on a
   map with **headcount, turnover, and industry**, AI **tagging & fit scoring**
   against your ICP, **account penetration** (which sites belong to OSS accounts
   and the relationship status), and one-click **CSV export** of any subset.

## Tech stack

| Concern        | Choice                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Framework      | Next.js 14 (App Router, TypeScript)                              |
| Styling        | Tailwind CSS                                                      |
| Database       | Prisma + SQLite (dev) — swap to Postgres for production          |
| Map            | MapLibre GL + OpenFreeMap tiles (no API key required)           |
| AI             | Claude (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) with a built-in heuristic fallback |
| Auth           | Passwordless magic links (signed JWT session cookie via `jose`) |
| Data ingestion | OpenStreetMap Overpass importer                                  |

Everything runs out-of-the-box with **no external keys** — Claude falls back to
a heuristic analyzer and magic links are printed to the server log.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Configure environment (defaults work for local dev)
cp .env.example .env
#    → optionally set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for real AI analysis

# 3. Create the database, generate the client, and load sample data
npm run setup        # = prisma db push + generate + seed

# 4. Run it
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

### Signing in (local dev)

By default e-mails are not actually sent — the magic link is printed to the
**server log** and also shown on the sign-in screen. Enter any `@oss.ventures`
address and click the link that appears.

To send real e-mails, set `EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend` and `RESEND_API_KEY` in `.env`.

## Loading real industrial sites (OpenStreetMap)

The seed gives you ~150 realistic sample sites. Real industrial sites come from
OpenStreetMap — there are two ways to import them.

### In the app (no terminal needed)

Go to **Data** in the sidebar (`/data`). Pick the countries, set a per-country
limit, and click **Sync**. Each country is imported in turn with live progress,
and the source counts update as it runs. When you're happy with the real data,
**Remove sample sites** clears the seed so the map shows only real sites.

### From the CLI

```bash
npm run import:osm -- --country FR --limit 400
npm run import:osm -- --country FR,DE,US --limit 400   # multiple at once
```

- `--country` — ISO-2 code(s), comma-separated (FR, DE, ES, IT, NL, BE, PL, GB, US)
- `--limit`   — max sites per country (default 400)
- `--endpoint`— alternate Overpass endpoint (default `OVERPASS_ENDPOINT`)

Both paths share the same logic (`src/lib/osm.ts`) and are idempotent —
re-running updates existing sites instead of duplicating them. OSM does not
carry headcount or turnover, so those are left empty on imported sites (enrich
them later from a registry or via the tagging tools). Industry is inferred from
OSM tags.

> **Network note:** importing calls the public Overpass API. The host must allow
> outbound HTTPS to `overpass-api.de` (or your configured `OVERPASS_ENDPOINT`).
> In a locked-down sandbox the sync surfaces a clear "host not in allowlist"
> error; on a normal deployment it works without configuration.

## How the two features work

### Signal Analyzer (`/signals`)

- Inputs: a profile name, website copy, and/or an ICP description.
- `POST /api/signals/analyze` runs `analyzeIcp()` (Claude, or heuristic if no
  key) and saves an `IcpProfile` with the structured result.
- The result lists signals grouped by category (Firmographic, Technographic,
  Trigger event, Pain point, …) with an importance level and where to observe
  each one, plus keywords and **suggested map filters**.
- "View on map →" opens `/map` pre-filtered to the suggested industries,
  countries and headcount range.

### Industrial Map (`/map`)

- Filter by search text, country, industry, relationship, headcount range and
  minimum fit score. Filters are shareable via the URL.
- Color points **by relationship** (account penetration) or **by fit score**.
- Pick an ICP profile and click **“Tag & score”** to AI-tag and fit-score the
  shown sites against that ICP.
- Click any site to open a detail panel: edit its **account & relationship**,
  add tags, or AI-tag just that site.
- **Export CSV** downloads exactly the current filtered subset.

### Accounts (`/accounts`)

Manage OSS accounts and their relationship status. Sites link to accounts from
the map; penetration metrics roll up on the dashboard.

## Environment variables

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for the full list. The important ones:

| Variable                  | Default                  | Purpose                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`            | `file:./dev.db`          | SQLite file (or a Postgres URL)           |
| `AUTH_SECRET`             | _(dev placeholder)_      | Signs sessions & tokens — **set in prod** |
| `APP_URL`                 | `http://localhost:3000`  | Base URL used to build magic links        |
| `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS`   | `oss.ventures`           | Comma-separated allowed sign-in domains   |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`       | _(empty → heuristic)_    | Enables Claude analysis & tagging         |
| `EMAIL_PROVIDER`          | `console`                | `console` or `resend`                     |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_STYLE_URL` | OpenFreeMap "liberty"  | MapLibre style URL                        |

---

## Going to production

1. **Database** — point `DATABASE_URL` at Postgres and change `provider` in
   `prisma/schema.prisma` to `postgresql`, then `npx prisma db push`. (For
   heavy geospatial querying you can later add PostGIS; the current filters are
   plain attribute/bounding-box queries and don't require it.)
2. **Secrets** — set a strong `AUTH_SECRET` (`openssl rand -base64 32`) and a
   correct `APP_URL`.
3. **E-mail** — set `EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend` + `RESEND_API_KEY` (and a verified
   `EMAIL_FROM`).
4. **AI** — set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to enable Claude.
5. `npm run build && npm start`.
